# efintechb Application Guide

This repo contains two services and Helm charts used to deploy to Kubernetes via Argo CD.

- Services
  - `application/lbsite/StatisticsAPI`
  - `application/lbsite/DeviceRegistrationAPI`
- Helm charts
  - Service charts: `infrastructure/helm/statisticsapi`, `infrastructure/helm/deviceregapi`
  - Umbrella chart: `infrastructure/helm/lbsite`
- Argo CD apps
  - TST: `infrastructure/kubernetes/argocd/lbsite-tst-app.yaml`
  - PRD: `infrastructure/kubernetes/argocd/lbsite-prd-app.yaml`

## Local Development

- Java version: JDK 17
- Build & test (from each service directory):

```bash
mvn -B test
mvn -B -DskipTests package
```

- Run locally (example StatisticsAPI):

```bash
cd application/lbsite/StatisticsAPI
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Environment variables are defined in Helm `values/*.yaml`; mirror locally as needed (JDBC URL, downstream URLs, etc.).

## Docker

- Build images locally (examples):

```bash
# StatisticsAPI
DOCKER_IMAGE=${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME:-balese}/statistics-api:dev
docker build -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE" application/lbsite/StatisticsAPI

# DeviceRegistrationAPI
DOCKER_IMAGE=${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME:-balese}/device-registration-api:dev
docker build -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE" application/lbsite/DeviceRegistrationAPI
```

- Run containers locally (example):

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME:-balese}/statistics-api:dev
```

## Environments and Deployment

- TST (immutable by digest)
  - Values file: `infrastructure/helm/lbsite/values/tst.yaml`
  - CI publishes images tagged with the commit SHA; the TST promoter resolves digests and opens a PR updating `tst.yaml` to pin `image.digest`.
  - After merging, Argo CD syncs to deploy the exact digests.

- PRD (release tags)
  - Values file: `infrastructure/helm/lbsite/values/prd.yaml`
  - A Git tag `vX.Y.Z` triggers image builds with that tag and opens a PR updating `prd.yaml` to use `image.tag: vX.Y.Z`.
  - After merging, Argo CD syncs to deploy the tagged images.

## CI/CD Overview

- Service CI workflows
  - `/.github/workflows/statistics-api-ci.yml`
  - `/.github/workflows/device-registration-api-ci.yml`
  - Triggers: push to `main`, push tags `v*`, pull_request (paths-limited)
  - Publishes Docker images:
    - `latest`
    - `sha` (commit SHA)
    - `vX.Y.Z` (on tag pushes)

- Promotion workflows
  - TST: `/.github/workflows/promote-tst.yml`
    - After successful build, resolves digests for the commit and opens a PR updating `values/tst.yaml` (digest pins).
  - PRD: `/.github/workflows/promote-prd.yml`
    - On tag push `v*`, opens a PR updating `values/prd.yaml` with the tag.
    - Merge PR to deploy.

## Release Flow (PRD)

1) Ensure changes are on `main`.
2) Create a tag and push it:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag -a v0.1.4 -m "Release v0.1.4"
git push origin v0.1.4
```

3) Verify in GitHub Actions:
   - Service CI runs and pushes images `statistics-api:v0.1.4`, `device-registration-api:v0.1.4`.
   - A PR “Promote PRD to tag:v0.1.4” appears.
4) Merge the PR; Argo CD deploys PRD.

## Checking Argo CD/Kubernetes

- Pods and deployments (adjust namespace):

```bash
kubectl -n lbsite-tst get pods
kubectl -n lbsite-prd get deploy
```

- If exposed via NodePort (example from `values/prd.yaml` for StatisticsAPI):

```bash
# Example for local Minikube
echo "http://$(minikube ip):30092/Log/auth/statistics?deviceType=IOS"
```

## Troubleshooting

- Images not tagged on Docker Hub after tag push
  - Ensure service CI `on.push.tags: ['v*']` is present and there is NO `on.push.paths` filter.
  - Check Docker Hub secrets: `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

- PRD promotion PR didn’t open
  - Confirm `/.github/workflows/promote-prd.yml` is on `main`.
  - Tag format must be `vX.Y.Z`.

- TST PR didn’t open
  - Ensure the originating workflow completed successfully and the SHA-tagged images exist.

- Argo CD didn’t update
  - Confirm the promotion PR was merged and the app is healthy/synced.
  - Verify `values/*.yaml` reflects the expected tag (PRD) or digest (TST).

## Useful Paths

- Services: `application/lbsite/*`
- Helm umbrella: `infrastructure/helm/lbsite/`
- Env values: `infrastructure/helm/lbsite/values/`
- Argo CD apps: `infrastructure/kubernetes/argocd/`
- Workflows: `/.github/workflows/`

This README is a quick ops/dev guide. If you need deeper details (schema, endpoints, DB), consider adding service-level READMEs under each service directory.

## Compliance checks

The repo includes a simple compliance/security scan workflow: `/.github/workflows/compliance-framework.yml`.

- What it does
  - Builds Docker images locally for each service:
    - `application/lbsite/DeviceRegistrationAPI`
    - `application/lbsite/StatisticsAPI`
  - Runs Trivy vulnerability scans on those images.
  - Uploads results as SARIF to GitHub Security.
  - Fails the job on findings (Trivy `exit-code: '1'`).

- How to run
  - Trigger manually from GitHub Actions: “Compliance Framework” (workflow_dispatch).

- Where to see results
  - Repository `Security` tab → `Code scanning alerts`.
  - Open the workflow run → download/view the SARIF artifacts:
    - `trivy-results-device-registration-api.sarif`
    - `trivy-results-statistics-api.sarif`

- Interpreting failures
  - The job fails if vulnerabilities are detected. Review alerts in the Security tab.
  - To remediate:
    - Update base images (e.g., `FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre` to a patched version).
    - Upgrade dependencies in Maven `pom.xml`.
    - Rebuild and re-run the scan.

- Mandatory in CI
  - The compliance scan is treated as a mandatory gate in CI. Pull requests must have a passing “Compliance Framework” check before they can be merged to `main`.
  - Enforce this via repository Branch protection rules by marking the “Compliance Framework” workflow as a required status check.
